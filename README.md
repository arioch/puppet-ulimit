# Ulimit Puppet Module

[![Puppet Forge](http://img.shields.io/puppetforge/v/svarrette/ulimit.svg)](https://forge.puppet.com/svarrette/ulimit) [![License](http://img.shields.io/:license-Apache2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE) ![Supported Platforms](http://img.shields.io/badge/platform-debian|redhat|centos-lightgrey.svg)

      Copyright (c) 2015-2017 Tom De Vylder (aka arioch), Sebastien Varrette (aka Falkor)

[ulimit](https://ss64.com/bash/ulimit.html) provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such control.

This [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) module is designed to configure and manage ulimits on your Linux system, mainly with the `ulimit::rule` definition which permits to define soft  and/or hard limits over various domains.

* The soft limit is the value that the kernel enforces for the corresponding resource.
* The hard limit acts as a ceiling for the soft limit.


**`/! IMPORTANT`: This module is a fork from [arioch/puppet-ulimit](https://github.com/arioch/puppet-ulimit/)!!!**
This was done to allow a version release on my own namespace compliant with Puppet 4 until [Tom/arioch](https://github.com/arioch) released the official new version on his module.
In the mean time, I added more features (vagrant-based tests, support for arrays, content and source) yet **this module is expected to disappear** once [Tom/arioch](https://github.com/arioch) (hopefully) integrate my pull-request.

In particular, this module implements the following elements:

* class `ulimit`: The main class, piloting all aspects of the configuration
* class `ulimit::config`: an **internal** class taking care of global configurations and defaults
* definition `ulimit::rule`: permiting to define a rule in `'/etc/security/limits.d/'`

All these components are configured through a set of variables you will find in [`manifests/params.pp`](https://github.com/Falkor/puppet-ulimit/blob/master/manifests/params.pp).

### Setup Requirements

This module have been successfully over Puppet 4.x. with:

* Debian 5 (Lenny)
* Debian 6 (Squeeze)
* CentOS 5
* CentOS 6
* CentOS 7
* RedHat 6
* RedHat 7

Over operating systems and support for Puppet 5.x will eventually be added.
Yet feel free to contribute to this module to help us extending the usage of this module.

## Forge Module Dependencies

See [`metadata.json`](https://github.com/Falkor/puppet-ulimit/blob/master/metadata.json).
In particular, this module depends on

* [puppetlabs/stdlib](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib)

## Overview and Usage

See also [`tests/rule.pp`](https://github.com/Falkor/puppet-ulimit/blob/master/tests/rule.pp)

---------------
```ruby
include ::ulimit

::ulimit::rule{ 'example1':
  ulimit_domain => '*',
  ulimit_type   => 'soft',
  ulimit_item   => 'nofile',
  ulimit_value  => '1024',
}
```

This will create the file `/etc/security/limits.d/80_example1.conf` with the following content:

      *       soft         nofile      1024

-------------
```ruby
include ::ulimit

::ulimit::rule{ 'example2':
  ulimit_domain => '*',
  ulimit_type   => 'soft',
  ulimit_item   => 'nofile',
  ulimit_value  => '1024',
}
```

This will create the file `/etc/security/limits.d/80_example2.conf` with the following content:

        *       hard         nproc        1024
        *       hard         nofile       1024

---------------
```ruby
::ulimit::rule{ 'slurm':
   ensure        => 'present',
   ulimit_domain => '*',
   ulimit_type   => [ 'soft', 'hard' ],
   ulimit_item   => [ 'memlock', 'stack' ],
   ulimit_value  => 'unlimited',
}
```

 This will create the file `/etc/security/limits.d/80_slurm.conf` with the
 following content:

       *       soft         memlock      unlimited
       *       soft         stack        unlimited
       *       hard         memlock      unlimited
       *       hard         stack        unlimited


----------------
```ruby
::ulimit::rule{ 'slurm-nproc':
   ensure        => 'present',
   priority      => 50,
   ulimit_domain => '*',
   ulimit_type   => [ 'soft', 'hard' ],
   ulimit_item   => 'nproc',
   ulimit_value  => '10240',
}
```

This statement should create `/etc/security/limits.d/50_slurm-nproc.conf` with the following content:

        *       soft         nproc        10240
        *       hard         nproc        10240

---------------
You can also pass the content yourself -- below statement will create  `/etc/security/limits.d/60_content.conf` with that content

```ruby
::ulimit::rule{ 'content':
   ensure   => 'present',
   priority => 60,
   content  => template('ulimit/test.erb'),
}
```

... or pass directly the source file -- below statement will create `/etc/security/limits.d/70_source.conf` with that content:

```ruby
::ulimit::rule{ 'source':
   ensure   => 'present',
   priority => 70,
   source   => 'puppet:///modules/ulimit/test.conf',
}
```


## Caveats

By default the module will purge any settings that are not managed by Puppet.
While not advised you can disable this feature:

    node /box/ {
      class { 'ulimit':
        purge => false,
      }
    }

## Developments / Contributing to the code

## Puppet modules tests within a Vagrant box

The best way to test this module in a non-intrusive way is to rely on [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/).
The `Vagrantfile` at the root of the repository pilot the provisioning various vagrant boxes available on [Vagrant cloud](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=&provider=virtualbox&q=svarrette) you can use to test this module.
